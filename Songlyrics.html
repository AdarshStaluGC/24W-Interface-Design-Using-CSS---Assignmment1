                <h1>Lyrics</h1>
                <p>Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year<br>
                    And terrors don't prey on<br>
                    Innocent victims<br>
                    Trust me, darling, trust me, darling<br>
                    It's been a loveless year<br>
                    I'm a man of three fears<br>
                    Integrity, faith and<br>
                    Crocodile tears<br>
                    Trust me, darling, trust me, darling<br>
                    So look me in the eyes<br></p>
                    <h3>That I'm a bad liar, bad liar</h3><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Make your heart believe<br>
                    But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
                    Now you know<br>
                    Now you know<br>
                    Problems, problems, problems<br>
                    So look me in the eyes<br>
                    Tell me what you see<br>
                    Perfect paradise<br>
                    Tearing at the seams<br>
                    I wish I could escape<br>
                    I don't wanna fake it<br>
                    Wish I could erase it<br>
                    Make your heart believe<br></p>
                    <h3>That I'm a bad liar, bad liar</h3><br>

                    <p>Now you know<br>
                    Now you know<br>
                    Now you know, you're free to go<br>
                    Oh<br></p>
                    <h3>That I'm a bad liar, bad liar</h3><br>
                    <p>Please believe me<br>
                    Please believe me</p>
